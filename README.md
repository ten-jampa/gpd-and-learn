Get Physics Done is an open-source AI copilot for physics research from [Physical Superintelligence PBC (PSI)](https://www.psi.inc), released as a community contribution. GPD helps turn a research question into a structured workflow: scope the problem, plan the work, derive results, verify them, and package the output.

## Who This Is For

GPD is for hard physics research problems that cannot be handled reliably with manual prompting.

It is designed for long-horizon projects that require rigorous verification, structured research memory, multi-step analytical work, complex numerical studies, and manuscript writing or review.

**This repository also documents a learning-engine extension built on top of GPD.** The base GPD framework handles research workflow orchestration; the added learning layer handles mastery-bounded active recall, independent assessment, persistent concept memory, FSRS/Bjork review scheduling, explanation caching, and a dedicated `gpd-learning` MCP server. See [`LEARNING_ENGINE_EXTENSION.md`](LEARNING_ENGINE_EXTENSION.md) for the contribution map.

We welcome contributions and feedback via GitHub issues or pull requests; if GPD is useful in your work, please star the repo, and share it with colleagues who might benefit.

## Quick Start

Install GPD:

```bash
npx -y get-physics-done
```

**Next steps after install**

The installer adds GPD to your runtime config, but it does not launch the runtime for you.

1. Open your chosen runtime from your normal system terminal (`claude` for Claude Code, `gemini` for Gemini CLI, `codex` for Codex, `opencode` for OpenCode).
2. Run its help command first: Claude Code / Gemini CLI use `/gpd:help`, Codex uses `$gpd-help`, and OpenCode uses `/gpd-help`.
3. Start with `new-project` for a fresh research project or `map-research` for an existing folder or project.

For best performance, run both this install step and your chosen runtime from your normal system terminal, not inside the VS Code, Cursor, or other AI runtime command/chat interface.

Then choose the path that matches your starting point:

| Starting point | First command | What it's for |
|----------------|---------------|----------------|
| New research project | `new-project` | Start a fresh GPD research workflow. |
| Existing research folder or codebase | `map-research` | Map existing work before planning. |
| Configure workflow and model defaults | `settings` | Set workflow toggles, tier models, and research preferences. |

Use the runtime-specific command syntax shown in [Supported Runtimes](#supported-runtimes), for example `/gpd:settings` or `/gpd:set-profile review`.

If you are starting from existing work, run `map-research` first to map the formalism, computations, conventions, validation status, and open questions before `new-project`.

Typical new-project workflow:

`new-project -> plan-phase 1 -> execute-phase 1 -> verify-work 1`

<details>
<summary><strong>Install options</strong></summary>

| Flag | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `--claude`, `--codex`, `--gemini`, `--opencode` | Select one runtime. `--claude-code` and `--gemini-cli` also work. |
| `--all` | Select all supported runtimes. |
| `--local`, `-l` | Use the current project only. |
| `--global`, `-g` | Use the global runtime config dir. |
| `--uninstall` | Uninstall from the selected runtime config instead of installing. |
| `--reinstall` | Reinstall the matching tagged GitHub source into `~/.gpd/venv`. |
| `--upgrade` | Upgrade `~/.gpd/venv` from the latest GitHub `main` source. |
| `--target-dir <path>` | Override the runtime config directory; implies local scope. |
| `--force-statusline` | Replace an existing runtime statusline during install. |
| `--help`, `-h` | Show bootstrap help. |

Ordinary installs stay pinned to the matching tagged release. Use `--upgrade` only when you intentionally want the latest unreleased `main` source.

Install the unreleased GitHub `main` snapshot explicitly:

```bash
npx -y github:psi-oss/get-physics-done --upgrade
```

</details>

## Supported Runtimes

GPD currently installs into four AI runtimes. To preselect one during install, use the matching `npx` flag, or use `--all` to install everything in one pass:

| Runtime | `npx` flag | Help command | Start command |
|---------|------------|--------------|---------------|
| Claude Code | `--claude` | `/gpd:help` | `/gpd:new-project` |
| Codex | `--codex` | `$gpd-help` | `$gpd-new-project` |
| Gemini CLI | `--gemini` | `/gpd:help` | `/gpd:new-project` |
| OpenCode | `--opencode` | `/gpd-help` | `/gpd-new-project` |

Each runtime uses its own command prefix, but the workflow is the same across all four. After installing GPD, open your chosen runtime normally from your system terminal and use the commands shown above.

Notes:
- Claude Code-specific note: GPD writes `.claude/settings.json` for hooks and statusline. MCP servers are added to project `.mcp.json` for local installs or `~/.claude.json` for global installs.
- Codex-specific note: GPD writes `.codex/config.toml` during install, enables `features.multi_agent = true`, configures the required notify hook and built-in MCP servers, registers GPD agent roles in `[agents.*]`, and for local installs exposes only public `gpd-*` agents there as discoverable skills in repo-scoped `.agents/skills/`; the full agent catalog still installs under `.codex/agents/` for direct invocation.
- Codex global skills use `CODEX_SKILLS_DIR` when set, or `~/.agents/skills/` by default.
- Gemini-specific note: GPD writes `.gemini/settings.json` during install, enables `experimental.enableAgents`, configures the required hooks and built-in MCP servers, and installs `policies/gpd-auto-edit.toml` for Gemini auto-edit shell approvals.
- OpenCode-specific note: GPD writes `.opencode/opencode.json` for local installs or `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` for global installs, installs flat `command/gpd-*.md` files, configures built-in MCP servers under the `mcp` key, and manages GPD-owned `permission.read` / `permission.external_directory` entries.

<details>
<summary><strong>Config path overrides</strong></summary>

| Runtime | Local config dir | Global config dir | Environment overrides |
|---------|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------|
| Claude Code | `./.claude/` | `~/.claude/` | `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Gemini CLI | `./.gemini/` | `~/.gemini/` | `GEMINI_CONFIG_DIR` |
| Codex | `./.codex/` | `~/.codex/` | `CODEX_CONFIG_DIR`; discoverable global skills use `CODEX_SKILLS_DIR` |
| OpenCode | `./.opencode/` | `~/.config/opencode/` | `OPENCODE_CONFIG_DIR`, `OPENCODE_CONFIG`, `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` |

GPD respects these overrides during install, uninstall, and runtime detection.

## What GPD Does

GPD guides research in four stages:

1. **Formulate**: asks targeted questions to pin down scope, assumptions, notation, and verification targets.
2. **Plan**: creates a phased roadmap with concrete tasks, dependencies, and success criteria.
3. **Execute**: runs specialist agents for derivations, numerical checks, literature work, and writing.
4. **Verify**: checks dimensional consistency, limiting cases, symmetry constraints, conservation laws, and numerical stability.

Each phase produces real artifacts such as `PROJECT.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `STATE.md`, `.tex` derivations, `.py` verification scripts, and figures.

GPD also locks conventions for up to 18 physics fields across a project so notation, sign choices, and verification assumptions stay consistent as phases accumulate.

## How Work Is Structured

GPD's main workflow in `.gpd/` is organized like this:

```text
Project
└── Milestone (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0, ...)
    └── Phase (1, 2, 2.1, 3, ...)
        └── Plan (01-01, 01-02, ...)
            └── Task
```

During execution, plans are grouped into waves:

```text
Wave 1: plans with no unmet dependencies
Wave 2: plans that depend on wave 1 outputs
Wave 3: plans that depend on earlier waves
```

- **Project**: the overall research workspace and its persistent context.
- **Milestone**: a major research checkpoint such as a paper submission, revision cycle, or result package. One project can have multiple milestones.
- **Phase**: one coherent chunk of work inside a milestone. Integer phases are planned work; decimal phases like `2.1` are inserted later when urgent work appears.
- **Plan**: the detailed execution breakdown for a phase, created by the runtime-specific `plan-phase N` command.
- **Wave**: not a separate top-level planning object, but the execution order inside a phase. Plans in the same wave can run in parallel; later waves depend on earlier ones.

Phase numbers continue across the whole project, so a new milestone may start at `Phase 6` rather than resetting to `Phase 1`.

## Worked Example

<details>
<summary><strong>Conformal bootstrap workflow</strong></summary>

The example below uses Claude Code / Gemini CLI syntax.

Suppose you want to use crossing symmetry and the numerical conformal bootstrap to bound low-lying operator dimensions in the 3D Ising CFT.

```text
/gpd:new-project
> Use crossing symmetry and the numerical conformal bootstrap to bound low-lying operator dimensions in the 3D Ising CFT.
```

GPD will:
- ask clarifying questions about the correlator sector, conventions, target observables, numerical precision, and verification strategy
- create `.gpd/PROJECT.md`, `.gpd/REQUIREMENTS.md`, `.gpd/ROADMAP.md`, and `.gpd/STATE.md`
- break the work into phases such as crossing-equation setup, derivative-basis construction, semidefinite-program formulation, convergence checks, and interpretation of the resulting bounds

Then continue with:

```text
/gpd:plan-phase 1
/gpd:execute-phase 1
/gpd:verify-work 1
```

Once the relevant phases are complete and verified, continue toward write-up with:

```text
/gpd:write-paper "3D Ising bootstrap bounds"
/gpd:arxiv-submission
/gpd:peer-review
/gpd:respond-to-referees
```

Typical artifacts include derivation notes, numerical scripts, convergence studies, and phase-level planning and verification documents under `.gpd/`.

## Key In-Runtime Commands

These commands run inside your installed AI runtime after GPD has been installed there. The examples below use Claude Code / Gemini CLI syntax.

### Common Starting Points

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `map-research` | Map an existing research project before `new-project` |
| `new-project` | Start a new research project |
| `plan-phase N` | Plan phase `N` with task breakdown and checkpoints |
| `execute-phase N` | Execute all tasks in phase `N` |
| `verify-work` | Run verification checks against current work |
| `peer-review` | Run manuscript peer review inside the current project before submission |
| `progress` | Show project state and recommend the next step |
| `discuss-phase N` | Explore a phase before committing to a plan |
| `quick` | Run a smaller task with a lighter workflow |
| `write-paper` | Draft a manuscript from completed research artifacts |
| `respond-to-referees` | Structure referee responses and revise the manuscript |
| `arxiv-submission` | Validate and package the manuscript for arXiv |

Typical research loop: `/gpd:new-project -> /gpd:plan-phase -> /gpd:execute-phase -> /gpd:verify-work -> repeat -> /gpd:complete-milestone`

Typical publication loop: `/gpd:write-paper -> /gpd:peer-review -> /gpd:respond-to-referees -> /gpd:arxiv-submission`

### Command Context

Not every GPD command needs the same amount of project state.

| Command type | Meaning | Examples |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| `Projectless` | Can run before `.gpd/PROJECT.md` exists | `/gpd:new-project`, `/gpd:map-research`, `/gpd:add-todo` |
| `Project-aware` | Uses project context when present, but can also run from explicit standalone inputs | `/gpd:discover "finite-temperature RG flow"`, `/gpd:explain "Ward identity"`, `/gpd:literature-review "axion monodromy"` |
| `Project-required` | Requires initialized GPD project state | `/gpd:progress`, `/gpd:plan-phase`, `/gpd:write-paper`, `/gpd:peer-review` |

Passing a manuscript path to a project-required command such as `/gpd:peer-review paper/` selects the manuscript target, but does not bypass project initialization.

## Learning Engine

The learning engine is the extension layer in this repository, built on top of the base GPD research-workflow framework. GPD handles the broader research lifecycle; this layer adds Feynman-style active recall, mastery assessment, persistent concept memory, review scheduling, and learning-specific MCP state management. For a concise map of what is unique to the extension, see [`LEARNING_ENGINE_EXTENSION.md`](LEARNING_ENGINE_EXTENSION.md).

The learning system is based on the principle: *"What I cannot create, I do not understand."*

The `learn` command runs a mastery-bounded loop:

```text
/gpd:learn "Ward identity" --type derive
```

**How it works:**

1. **Challenge** — a `gpd-tutor` agent generates a calibrated physics challenge (recall, derive, or apply)
2. **Attempt** — you submit your work inline or by file reference
3. **Assess** — a `gpd-mastery-assessor` independently verifies your work and assigns a mastery level (0–4)
4. **Adapt route** — if prerequisites are weak, the loop suggests a soft bridge path (`--type recall` or `gpd:explain`) before continuing
5. **Teach gaps** — if below mastery, `gpd-explainer` teaches the specific gaps identified
6. **Re-attempt** — the loop repeats with adaptive challenge type/difficulty based on your latest assessment
7. **Mastery** — the loop ends when you reach Level 3 (Understanding) or higher

**Mastery levels:**

| Level | Name | What it means |
|-------|------|---------------|
| 0 | Incomplete | Did not finish or skipped |
| 1 | Recall | Can state the result but not derive it |
| 2 | Mechanical | Can follow steps but can't explain WHY each works |
| 3 | Understanding | Can derive AND articulate physical meaning, assumptions, limitations |
| 4 | Fluency | Can derive, explain, AND transfer to related problems |

The critical boundary is Level 2 → 3: correct computation vs. genuine understanding.

**When to use each challenge type:**

- `--type recall` — use when prerequisites feel shaky or you cannot start a derivation confidently.
- `--type derive` — use when fundamentals are present and you want step-by-step reconstruction.
- `--type apply` — use after derive/recall to test transfer to new settings.

**Spaced repetition and memory tracking:**

When you reach mastery (Level 3+), the learning engine activates long-term retention:

- **FSRS-6 scheduling** — an evidence-based spaced repetition algorithm schedules optimal review dates. Check what's due with `--review`:
  ```text
  /gpd:learn --review
  ```
- **Bjork dual-strength memory** — tracks *storage strength* (how deeply encoded) and *retrieval strength* (how accessible now, decays over time). High storage = slower decay, so well-drilled concepts fade more slowly.
- **Explanation caching** — full concept explanations are cached at `.gpd/explanations/{slug}-EXPLAIN.md` and shared between `/gpd:learn` and `/gpd:explain`. Second request is instant.

All learning state is managed by the `gpd-learning` MCP server (12 tools), keeping it completely separate from research state (`gpd-state`).

Session artifacts are organized per concept under `.gpd/learning/{slug}/`:

- `SESSION.json` (active loop state)
- `MEMORY.json` (concept memory with FSRS card + Bjork strengths, schema v2)
- `CHALLENGE.md`, `ASSESSMENT-{N}.md`, `EXPLANATION-{N}.md`

Cross-session summary remains in `.gpd/learning/LEARNING-LOG.md`.

## Local Development

To develop GPD locally and test changes to commands, agents, or workflows:

```bash
uv sync --dev              # Install dependencies
uv build                   # Build the package
uv run ruff check .        # Lint (must pass)
uv run pytest tests/ -v    # Run tests

# Reinstall locally for your runtime (picks up new/changed files)
npx -y get-physics-done --claude --local --reinstall
npx -y get-physics-done --codex --local --reinstall
```

Local installs go to `./.claude/` or `./.codex/` (project-scoped) and take precedence over global installs at `~/.claude/` or `~/.codex/`. Restart your runtime after reinstalling to pick up changes.

## Optional: Model Profiles And Tier Overrides

GPD maps runtime-specific model names onto three capability tiers. Most users can leave this at the runtime default and only adjust it if they want to tune planning, execution, or verification behavior.

| Tier | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `tier-1` | Highest capability |
| `tier-2` | Balanced default |
| `tier-3` | Fastest / most economical |

Available profiles are `deep-theory`, `numerical`, `exploratory`, `review`, and `paper-writing`.

| Runtime | Set profile | Open settings |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Claude Code / Gemini CLI | `/gpd:set-profile review` | `/gpd:settings` |
| Codex | `$gpd-set-profile review` | `$gpd-settings` |
| OpenCode | `/gpd-set-profile review` | `/gpd-settings` |

<details>
<summary><strong>Runtime-specific model string examples</strong></summary>

When you set explicit tier overrides, the model string is runtime-native. GPD passes it through unchanged, so it must match what that runtime already accepts:

- **Claude Code**: aliases like `opus`, `sonnet`, `haiku`, `default`, `sonnet[1m]`, or a provider-native pinned model ID. If your Claude Code install is backed by Bedrock, Vertex, or Foundry, use that provider's deployment/version identifier.
- **Codex**: the exact string Codex accepts for its `model` setting. If you configured a non-default Codex `model_provider`, keep that provider's exact model ID format.
- **Gemini CLI**: an exact Gemini model name accepted by your installed Gemini runtime. Prefer exact model names for GPD tier overrides rather than the interactive Auto picker.
- **OpenCode**: a full `provider/model` string such as `anthropic/<model>`, `openai/<model>`, or `google/<model>`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual config example</strong></summary>

Per-project tier settings live in `.gpd/config.json` under `model_overrides`:

```json
{
  "model_profile": "review",
  "model_overrides": {
    "codex": {
      "tier-1": "your-tier-1-codex-model",
      "tier-2": "your-tier-2-codex-model",
      "tier-3": "your-tier-3-codex-model"
    },
    "claude-code": {
      "tier-1": "opus",
      "tier-2": "sonnet",
      "tier-3": "haiku"
    },
    "gemini": {
      "tier-1": "your-tier-1-gemini-model",
      "tier-2": "your-tier-2-gemini-model",
      "tier-3": "your-tier-3-gemini-model"
    }
  }
}
```

Valid runtime keys are `claude-code`, `codex`, `gemini`, and `opencode`. If no override is set for the active runtime, GPD uses that runtime's default model.

</details>

## Advanced CLI Utilities

The `gpd` CLI also includes machine-readable validation, observability, and tracing commands for automation, review-grade checks, and debugging.

<summary><strong>Observability and trace inspection</strong></summary>

GPD stores project-local observability under `.gpd/observability/` and detailed plan traces under `.gpd/traces/`.

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `gpd observe sessions [--status ...] [--command ...] [--last N]` | List recorded observability sessions |
| `gpd observe show [--session ...] [--category ...] [--name ...] [--action ...] [--status ...] [--command ...] [--phase ...] [--plan ...] [--last N]` | Show logged observability events with filters |
| `gpd observe event <category> <name> [--action ...] [--status ...] [--command ...] [--phase ...] [--plan ...] [--session ...] [--data <json>]` | Append an explicit observability event with optional structured metadata |
| `gpd trace start <phase> <plan>` | Start a plan-local trace session |
| `gpd trace log <event> [--data <json>]` | Append an event to the active trace |
| `gpd trace stop` | Stop the active trace session |
| `gpd trace show [--phase ...] [--plan ...] [--type ...] [--last N]` | Inspect plan-local trace events |

| Path | What it stores |
|------|----------------|
| `.gpd/observability/sessions/*.jsonl` | Per-session event logs |
| `.gpd/observability/current-session.json` | Latest session metadata for status and resume tooling |
| `.gpd/traces/` | Plan-local execution traces for debugging and post-mortem review |
| `.gpd/STATE.md` | Concise human-readable continuity state, not the full event ledger |

Low-level function and span calls are not recorded automatically. Observability is reserved for explicit workflow facts, trace lifecycle, and any agent or subagent events surfaced by the active runtime.

<summary><strong>Manuscript build</strong></summary>

| Command | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| `gpd paper-build [PAPER-CONFIG.json] [--output-dir <dir>]` | Materialize the canonical manuscript scaffold from `paper/PAPER-CONFIG.json`, emit `main.tex`, bibliography artifacts, and the paper artifact manifest |

</details>

## System Requirements

- Node.js with `npm`/`npx`
- Python 3.11+ with the standard `venv` module (install a newer version with `brew install python@3.13` on macOS, `pyenv install 3.13` on Linux, or from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) on Windows)
- Network access to npm and GitHub for the bootstrap installer
- One of: Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex, or OpenCode
- API access for the model provider used by your selected runtime

## Known Limitations

- Runtime-internal tool and subagent detail is limited by what the active provider/runtime exposes. GPD records the workflow, session, and trace events it can emit locally, but it does not fabricate opaque provider internals.

## Uninstall

Run `npx -y get-physics-done --uninstall` for interactive uninstall. The equivalent subcommand form `npx -y get-physics-done uninstall` also works, and you can add the runtime and scope flags above for a non-interactive uninstall.

Uninstall removes GPD from the selected runtime config only. It does not delete project `.gpd/` artifacts or shared files under `~/.gpd`; remove `~/.gpd/` manually, or `GPD_HOME` if you used it, for a full wipe after uninstalling from all runtimes.

## Inspiration

GPD takes its name in explicit analogy with [GSD (Get Shit Done)](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done), whose adoption demonstrates how AI-native command workflows can be genuinely useful. GPD takes inspiration from that system to build a sophisticated prompt-engineered agentic system specifically designed for physics research.
